\chapter{Achieved Results}\label{chap:results}

% To bridge this gap is the primary motivation and contribution of ours.  In this
% paper, we present \emph{RoFI} -- a new platform of distributed metamorphic
% robots that is open-hardware and open-source, hence almost freely available to
% anyone interested. We designed our metamorphic robotic platform on top of the
% actual results of other teams, and in a way, that other researchers may easily
% create a physical copy of the platform on their own. We provide enough
% documentation to mitigate the challenge of software development for the
% platform, and we encourage others to use our platform to demonstrate the results
% of their work. We believe a general publically available platform for
% metamorphic robots is beneficial for the whole community. It will prevent others
% from reinventing the wheel while producing their own robots and research
% results.
